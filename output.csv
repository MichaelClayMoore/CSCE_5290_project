review
 This case is a great value. I bought this for my boyfriend and he is thrilled.
 The best!
" I've put this windscreen for over 6 months and it fits the mic perfectly.  I don't know how it works properly, but it does not work for me."
 Just what I needed.
 Nice for the price.
 This guitar is built like a tank and is very well made. It doesn't give you an issue. It looks better and stays in tune. It's a very reasonably priced guitar but for the price you won't find a better deal for guitar.
 I bought this guitar because of the price of the product. It's a good guitar and its a good price.
 Item as expected.
" I bought this item and it works great. The only problem with the controller is that it is not adjustable, and is it just so bad?

The product itself is pretty cheap and it is not what I was looking for.  I have a Yamaha keyboard and I know."
 This is a great product.  It has a very good quality tone and durability.  I am not disappointed.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
 Good price
" This is the first pick I have ever used, and it is the best picks I've ever used."
 I love the sound!!
 This is the first pedal board that I bought and it's a good value.
" I ordered this model for my son and he loves it!  The quality is excellent and the price was very reasonable.  It's a perfect tuner for my son, who has his guitar tuned very well."
" This is a good value string, but not for the price."
 A lot more expensive than the brand I used in the late 1980's.
 Great product!
" I love this thing, I can't say. The sound quality is great."
" I bought this item based on how it was described.  The item was shipped promptly.  The product I received is perfectly functional and comes with a little setup.  I was able to attach it to a wall to a wall mount.  I like to use this product, but the sound is better.  I'll try another one for a friend,  I really don't know how it will hold up.  But this is a great deal!"
 This is the best strap for the price I paid.  It's nice for the price!
 I bought this to be my first electric guitar. I'm not sure what to expect from a guitar. I've bought this for my 5th one and it is perfectly made. The case is very solid and functional.
 great
 I'm in the band and this is my goin' case. I'm not sure what to say.
 I love the strings. The quality is excellent and the string is perfect.
 We got this for my 4 yr old son. He is a musician and it loves the sound.
 I got this for my husband and he says he is perfect.
" This is a great microphone for the price and quality.  It is very sturdy, I can't ask for more!"
 I'm a very happy camper.  I know I'll use this for a backup.  The case is very durable for this price range.
 The strings are cheap. They seem to last a lifetime.
 good and good
" I'm glad I got the pedal to sing.  The pedal gives you a great sound.  The pedal is well made.  The only reason I don't give it 5.  I'm not expecting that because its more expensive and pricey.  I don't know how it is.  But this pedal is not the one I was using.  This pedal feels so much more like the pedal.  It's not going to perform with you.  I'd say that it would be a nice addition to my pedalboard.  The only down side and down side is that you may want to take it out of the box when you hit it.  If you're not going to save a few bucks, I'd buy it.  I'm not sure if this was a worthwhile investment."
 I love this for my granddaughters karaoke machine. She has a karaoke machine for her other interest.
 I got these for my daughter and she loves them.  They are a bit pricey but they work very well.
 Perfect
 Great product!  Good price for the best!  What more can I say? 
 Works great! It was exactly what I needed.
" My son love this music stand, sounds great, and we all have to say is that this item does the job."
 I'm so glad I bought them. They work just as expected for the price.
 I have used a few different brands of this strap for years. I love it.
 I bought this for a friend and she loves it!!! The quality is very good. I have had a set of these for a few year old and they were really good for the price
 the price was very reasonable. It came in a timely manner. it was described and the product was exactly what I was looking for.
" The strap is great, and I got this strap to fit my guitar. No problems at all, and I love the strap to be able to be really comfortable to wear."
 I purchased this product to hang my guitar. It is a bit expensive but it does the job.
" I bought this pick, and it was great. It is a good pick to have when you're playing guitar!"
 Great product
 This is absolutely fantastic strings.  I've used them for years and they are great.  They sound just as they should.
" I've had this for a couple years, I'm not a real musician.  I wouldn't like the strap, what I would do is do it?  I'd really like to buy another one.  This one is not meant for a gigging session.  I know that this strap was the one it is made but it's not.  I've just spent a few minutes with it, and it can't be repaired."
 I've played on a couple of my acoustics and these strings are the best.  The best acoustic strings I've played on.  The best strings that I've used.  I used them on my electrics and they sounded great.
 Works great!
" I have been using this for a long time and it works very well.

The product is good quality, which is a good product and comes with the mic adapter."
 Nice case for any non-warrantying your guitar. You can buy a case that is NOT recommended.
 I bought this as a gift. It looks like a very well made product. I would say it is great for the price.
 These are the best!!
" I have used this item for years, and I'm pretty impressed.  I use it every day!  It is a great product, and will update if it is in the product line.  I don't know how much I can get that.  I use it for gigs and it does the job.
  The instructions are pretty basic but they are great for a home studio.  I have no idea what I will say about this product except for practice."
" I have a Shure SM8 that I use for interviews.

For interviews I use this windscreen for a microphone and mic/audio interviews.

The windscreen fits the mic snugly on my mic.
LIP filter is pretty tight.
The windscreen is a little tight but its very flexible.

The windscreen for SM8HT-04/3/4-inch windscreen for SM8HT-04/2 windscreen for SM8HT-04, SM8HT/2 windscreen for SM8HT/2 wind SM8HT/2 windscreen for SM8HT/2 windscreen.

I use this windscreen on my mic and it works perfectly.

No problem with it, or I was using it before my mic.

I use it, it fits the mic and it fits the mic.

The windscreen has a good price."
 This is a really great invention for the price. i use it every day to my rehearsal.  i use it every day and it works really well and i can do it.
" I am very satisfied. I will update as soon as I can get it, but it keeps my money's worth."
" I bought this to use with my pedalboard. It works perfectly for keeping pedals pedals, which are great. I got it as a gift for a friend, who was not happy with it."
 I use this for vocals and I was very satisfied.  I needed a cheap mic that I would be able to play on a friend's mic.  I got this one for my friends and he has no complaints.  I didn't have to buy this one when we bought it but I'm glad I did.  Great product.
 Good price for the price I paid.
 It works well for my 9v battery.
 I purchased this for my son who loves to learn to play. He said that it was a gift but it is a good deal.
 Perfect item
 Excellent
 I wish it wasn't painted.  It's a sturdy wood that is not as sturdy as I have yet had.  It is sturdy and works as intended.
 I like the sound of the sound. The sound is good and the price was reasonable.
 Good quality
 Just what I needed.
 Good price for quality strings.
 I have had one for a few years and it's good.  The strap is very sturdy and it's worth every penny.
 I bought this for my teenage sister who are very pleased. She's an instrument and she loves music.
 I bought this item for my daughter's electric guitar and she loves it!
 Great stand.
" I'm using this for years.  I can tell that it is a very good product, I use it for Christmas.  I think this product was recommended into anyone who plays a musician.  It is extremely sturdy and will last a long time."
 Very good quality and quality.
 Great product.  Great deal.
 Great product
 I bought this item for my 7 yr old son and he loves it. He has loved it.
 A+++
 I use this for my guitar and it works great for what I need.  I use it for my guitar and it works just fine.  I use it for a guitar and it is great!
 I'm using this with a Yamaha keyboard. When it was shipped it was exactly what I expected. It sounds great and I couldn't be happier. I'm glad I did.
 I bought this product and it works great.
 I have had these picks for many years. I have a couple of these and they're always working.
 great product
 This is a fantastic product for the price! I love it!
 This thing is it's amazing.  I have a couple of these in my home studio and the quality of the sound is much better.  The sound is great and I'm really happy with the quality.  I have a pair of small condenser mics but the sound quality seems great.  I had a problem with this mic so I knew I would have a bad one.  I decided to buy this one because I was just impatient at the price of the studio.  I plugged the mic directly into the mic and plugged it into a mic and I couldn't be happier!  I plugged a mic and plugged it into my laptop and it connected to my mic and started recording with the sound.  I plugged it into my pc and plugged the PC into the mic and plugged it into a stereo and plugged it into my pc and plugged it into my laptop.  I plugged a mic into my laptop and I was playing with my video camera and plugged it into a mixer.  I'm not going to get a better one either.

" I have some of my pedals and has been using this for years.  I have been using this product for a while.  It is a good product, and I am using it for live gigging."
 Thank you
" Works great, a great price!!"
 I'm a musician and I will say that I love these strings and they are an improvement.  The strings feel great and they look nice.  I've only used them for a couple days now and there are these are still the best strings I've ever used.
 Good quality pick
 If you like the sound of these these are your best choice. They are good enough for the price.
 Very nice.
 I bought this product because we bought it for my husband. He is a professional and he is happy!
 Exactly what I needed.  Works perfectly. The guitar is comfortable.  Very functional.
 I got the Hosa CTR-225. They sound great.
 Love these strings!

" The Yamaha YAC-1000A for beginners. It is a real deal, and I am not disappointed. It is a great size and it is a very comfortable guitar. It is a very nice touch and sounds great."
 This mic is not very good quality. but it is better than any one I have ever used. I am using it to protect my mic from my Shure SM48-LC VHF.
" The item was exactly what I expected. I bought it, and it looks great!"
 The product was exactly what I expected and it was exactly what I needed.
 I purchased this product after I had to use it for a day.  This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.
" I am a little lazy to find an e-30 turntable.
I'm a beginner and I don't want to have to spend a little more money on a good vinyl.
I have no idea what I was doing but I am pleased with this purchase and will totally buy this one for my new turntable.

I can't go wrong with this product and won't be a musician. I've been using this for years and it seems to be working."
 good
" I have not found it, but this one is a bargain. It's a great pedal."
""
 Good quality
" I'm not a super expert on music, but it is a really easy way to set up.  I would not have to purchase another one, but I'm hoping that's because I'm new to music.  I'm very happy with these choices."
 I'm hoping I'll get the best and is a super light for the money
 Great
 I bought this for my husband. He loves this one. He plays with it. He loves it. We don't know it doesn't be a real deal breaker.
 This is my first one of all. It works great.
" I purchased this to add my guitar to my guitar case.  The product is well made and works great.  The case is a little pricey for your guitar, but it has a very good deal of features.  It has a zipper, which is a little pricey."
 I bought this strap for my boyfriend's music store and I am extremely happy with the quality and quality.
 Just what I needed for my granddaughters guitar. She loves it.
" I purchased this for my daughter, and I love it. She has an interest in music and she loves it. I'm sure she will be playing it for her next session."
 Great quality and great price
 Thanks
 Good
" I've been using these strap for years. I've used Gibson's straps for years. I can't believe they're comfortable in my shoulder's when it's in the guitar case. If you want the comfort and comfort you'd want, then these straps are the strap for you."
 I've had this guitar for years and i couldn't be happier with the quality. I love the sound and the sound quality. I'm just looking forward to learning to play chords. I recommend this guitar to anyone who wants to learn to play.
 I like this product. I am very impressed with the quality of this product.
 I bought this for my son's guitar. He says it works well and it looks nice. It is a good value for the price
 I've been using these strings on my guitar for a long time and they stay in tune and sound great.
" The neck is so comfortable, the neck is really small and comfortable.  I don't know how to play, but for the price I was very satisfied."
" I can tell that this strap is very comfortable and easy to use. Very comfortable, sturdy. I've had to learn to play the guitar, and this guitar is the most comfortable strap for me."
 Great
" I'm a professional musician and I'm very pleased with this mic. The only thing I can say about this unit is the fact it doesn't come with the mic is that it's so big for me. I am not much more experienced about this mic, but it's a really solid, well built, and worth every penny!"
 The Levy's are the best straps. Levy's just the right size and they are comfortable.
 The best
 Great product
 The stand is good and well made.
" Just what I was looking for.  Sounds pretty good.  I've had this for a couple weeks now and i love it.  I plan to give it 5 stars, because however I'm an amateur musician and I'm not sure it would work in my case.  I'm having trouble keeping my guitar at the guitar case, but my guitar seems to work pretty well.  I have a Yamaha FCX50 that sounds better.  I must say that the guitar is a bit better, but I'm not going to be playing for a while."
" I can't even play with it but I've found it as a gift for my child. The book is small enough to be able to play with it. It's perfect for him as a starter, as I have a friend who is into the song and has a interest in learning."
 Ive had a lot of these for years. They are very sturdy and they are inexpensive.
 nice
" I don't know, but I am very satisfied."
 I use this all the time and it works perfectly. I have a lot of these in my home studio and the one I use it for my home studio.
" This is the best pedal board I've ever used.  I only wish it had a little more options for it.

I've owned it for years and it works great, and I can't imagine that it has never worked out yet, I'm not using it, but it's not the pedal board, I've had it for over a year now.

I'm not a fan of this pedal, so I have to say, it's the best pedal board I've ever used.  The pedalboard has a nice clean-out effect that is to dial in or out.  The pedals are so nice and it's a few reasons I don't like.  It's not a great pedal board, but it's not the best pedalboard/plugs and pedals to be used for."
 I bought these for my daughter for her daughter's birthday.  She loves the sound quality of the sound.
 Works great.
 Very consistent reeds.
 Good quality strings.
 This was my first electric guitar and it sounds Great!
" I got these for my son and he is thrilled and says he will be playing with his guitar.  He had only owned one that was broken, and that is a lot he won't be able to handle.  He's still an absolute beginner but this guitar should have cost more than $50."
 I'm glad I did
" I bought this product to try one of those wall hangers, and I was very pleased to find the product for the price.

I'm not sure what I was doing but I'm glad I did."
 It was a gift and my son loves it.
" I purchased this for my son, he loves it!"
" I bought this item from Amazon because I was not expecting a single coil sound from a standard headphone amplifier, this is a common issue. The sound is very clear, and is more complex. The sound is good.

I'm not sure what I'm doing since I have to say in a review. The headphone jack is no matter what I'm using it for. I had to plug it in and plug it in. I was running the sound and it sounded like a real man's recording.

I know that they are not good at all but for me you will probably know, but I'm not sure if I'm really doing the job, but I can't tell you.

The Behringer U-Control UCA202 Ultra-Compact Monitor Speakers is a really cheap product and the price is well worth the price, and if you're considering this product to anyone who has a new amplifier, I would definitely recommend this item."
" This metronome is perfect. It is a great price and the price was only thing that I would not buy it. I am really satisfied, it is a very good metronome that I highly recommend one at gigs."
 The set is cheap and the product was shipped in it's box.  The shipping was shipped promptly.
 I've seen the Behringer and it's just the one you can buy. The sound is nice and the price is right.
 I have had this for a few years now and it does the job.
 I use this for a wedding ceremony ceremony. I got it for my son's birthday.
" The product does not work very well, I have had it for a couple of months. I must have to buy another one."
 I was expecting something that would fit my guitar perfectly. The guitar is not a good case for the price.
 I've used Dunlop Tortex for years.  These picks are the best.
 Just as described.
 I love it
 This is my second one with all three switches.
" I love this strap for my acoustic guitar. The strap is so comfortable, and looks great."
 The best strings for the price.
" Very good quality for the price. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn to play with, you will absolutely love it."
 great
" I'm an intermediate level, so I bought this device to use on my pc. It sounds great, and will definitely be use for a preamp."
 Perfect
" great strap, great price!"
" The strings that came with my guitar are too high to high, and it was not to the best deal. Will not buy again.  The worst part is the strings you've ever bought a guitar."
" These are the best straps you can buy.  I own a guitar and a guitar, and these are very comfortable and they are adjustable so that they don't jump around to heavy use.  I don't know how long they are over priced.  The fact that they don't last longer than most guitars are not long enough for my guitar.  The reason this is that they won't fit in my guitar is for me.  They are pretty comfortable, and they are comfortable.  I own a Gibson Les Paul Custom Custom II Tele, which were all about 6 months ago, and I can tell they work great.  I got 5 months ago's, and they are just as comfortable as my Gibson Les Paul Custom II.  The only thing I didn't like about this Tele is that I like about them, and they are not heavy duty."
" These are well made, and they don't get the job done, so far so good.  These are the best you can buy, and they just don't break (as to if you are not in tune, but it is a good price for the price)"
" I love this cord. But I don't know how to use it yet, but I will update this review."
" Good, good quality, and will last for future."
" This metronome works great.  It is so easy to set up and very portable.  It is easy to set up to a piano session, and I am no petite!"
 I love this thing!!!!!!!! It fit nicely and it was a great deal!
 I bought this item to hang my guitar. It was exactly what I expected as well. I would definitely buy again.
" I have always had good luck with this microphone. I am a voice engineer and I am not an audiobox. I use this as a mic-studio. I use it with a small room for voice, karaoke. I would recommend this mic."
 Just what I needed.
 Great product
 Great strap for the price. I only use 6 for a few other guitars for acoustic guitar.
 I've been playing guitar for decades and I love the guitar.
 Very well made.
 Does what it is supposed to do.
" I use this at a gig, and it works very well. It was a bonus because the battery is not included, and not, but it is a very functional tool. This thing is so useful for tuning a pedal, even if you're not familiar with a pedal, but it is useful.

The only thing I not like is that it is a little accurate and accurate. I don't really use it at all."
 I was expecting this but it was the wrong size and the price was a fine.
 The unit is a little high quality and will last longer.  I bought this for my 8 year old son.
" I'm a bit lazy to know how to get the correct pitch and I'm not sure what I was done.  I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, but I'm not sure what I was wrong."
 Very good
 This is a great cable.
 I bought this product because it is for the guitar. The sound is very nice. This product is super quality for the price. The product is very cheap I'm using it for. I would recommend this product to anyone.
" I've only had this for a week now, and I'm glad i'm using this for my new guitar."
 I just got this guitar for my daughter and her friends.  The guitar was broken and is cracked.  This guitar was a $5 guitar.  The guitar was damaged but I can't find some of the other reviews say.  So far she hasn't been playing guitar for 46 years.
 i bought this for my 2 year old son and it works fine.
 The best strings I've ever used. I've noticed a wonderful tone and durability.
 I bought this strap because it was a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. He is so glad he is more satisfied.
" I bought this for my niece for her daughter in middle school. She says she loves it. She says that it is a great product, because she loves it. He loves it, sounds like a rocker and his friends are really happy."
 excellent price.
 Love these strings and they are very durable.
" I love this microphone. I'm not a professional level player, but this thing does everything I want.  It's fun to play.  The sound is nice and clear.  The mic doesn't have the same sounds quality as any other microphone.  If you're looking for a great mic this is great for the price."
" I've used Elixirs for years and won't let me down!  They are great strings, and they last a long time."
" I purchased this for my teenage son, he loves to play. He has an ear, that is an instrument. He is an avid guitarist and says he is very good and he is able to sing while he has. He absolutely loves it!"
" This is the best pedal for any kind of music.  Easy to set up and it's so cool.  The pedal is easy to operate and the pedal is very good.  The price is right and the pedal is good and is not bad.  The only thing I don't like is that you can use it is that you can only use it as a pedal.  This pedal is going to be a power amp for you.  If you can use it as a practice amp you can use a power amp, but then you know that you have to use it as a power amp.  The pedal can connect a power cable and a power cable.  I use it as a practice amp.  And my practice amp is so good.  The only downside is the power cord is that you can be just plug it into a power strip and it is not going to be able to power in a power strip.  The cable that connects the cable and the cord directly into a power strip.  This is a good deal and the amp is not a problem at all.  I don't think it's going to be a bad deal.  If you are looking for a full power amp with a"
 I like this product. I am satisfied and will buy more
 The best
" I purchased this item to add a microphone to my desk. Excellent quality, and very sturdy. I am very pleased."
" I'm not an expert on harmonica, but it does the job perfectly."
" I am an absolute beginner's guide. I needed something with a few notes and just got this. The chord method is easy to follow and it works great. I was using it in a band where I did not like to play chords. But, I am not sure about learning and I am very happy with this thing."
 The product was of good quality and it was exactly what I needed.
 This is a very good strap for the price. The quality is excellent. This strap is comfortable and attractive. The length is also good for me to play at a gig.
 I use this to hold my keyboard down.  It has the ability to be able to take all of my piano lessons and my practice was not recommended.
 I love it!
 I purchased this for my Son and he loves it! It looks great and does a good job for the price.
 I bought this for a friend who wanted to learn to play guitar again. The one I bought was a good weight and the price was great.
 This is a gift for a friend. He loves it. He has played it every day and he is very happy.
" A good price, worth the price."
 The product is really good and great quality.
" This tool is simple and I don't really know if and it does not work for something but just not. It works great, I have been using it for a year and it works well."
 I really like the sound of this product.  The sound is very good for beginners.  It is not a real deal breaker but we are very pleased with this purchase.
" I bought this item on ""I bought this for my daughters guitar. It is the most sturdy wall hanger I had ever used for her guitar. She loves it."
 I got the wrong size.
" I was a little hesitant when I first started to tune this guitar, but it was just a joy. It's a great guitar. I've never had it, but I think it's really fun."
 I recently picked it up and it is like a gift. It is great and has a great sound. I bought it for my boyfriend and he is really happy with it.
 I bought this item in late 1980 and it worked great. I have it in my home studio and its great.
 i have to send it back in to the day and I can no better
" I love this product! It's very good quality and I can't be happier, I hope to buy one."
 These are my preferred picku/
 I was very pleased with this one. I have 2 and one for each one. This one is the second one and I play with it. The volume is low and I know it does. I am not experienced with this product. I use it as a Furman. The one I bought it in this Furman is the best. The only bad is it is that if you are looking for the right size for your Furman. The first one is that it is a little small for you.
 This is a great product and I am no audiophile. It is an incredible unit. It's a must have for your needs.
" This is a well made product, and as advertised, it is very well made, and it was exactly what I needed it for."
 I'm using this for my daughter's music class.  I'm just a beginner's and I'm a beginner's teacher and she's thrilled with her music.
" I was looking for a guitar that had a little more room. It's not a good deal. The neck was too high and I can't play the guitar without it. So I don't know if it is my choice. The guitar is a little too high for the price and I'm guessing this is not a good deal. If that matters, I will buy another one."
" I bought these microphones for my first one ever, and they are pretty clear.  I like the sound, but they are not expensive.  These are not that great in every way.  You'll be able to test them out in a future.  They're not audiophile's, but they are a good value.  They sound, and the price is right.  I use them for wedding performance and I am pleased."
 I bought this for my granddaughters first instrument.  I'm not expecting it to be as well.  I'm satisfied with the purchase.
 Exactly what I was looking for. It works great on my ukulele.
" This strap is great, and it arrived in perfect condition. I am very pleased."
 Works very good
 I purchased this item and received it earlier than I expected.  I'm very impressed and am satisfied with it.  Very sturdy and I'm glad I did.
 I bought this for my 2yr old daughter and she is really pleased with her. She loves the sound quality.
 The strap is only leather and my guitar is pretty comfortable.  It is a really comfortable strap but it is not that comfortable and comfortable. The straps are comfortable and the strap is not comfortable.  I would not buy it again.
" I bought this mixer for my son's first keyboard, it worked just fine."
 I bought this for my granddaughters son.  He loves it.
 I used to use this coating for years and it was a great price.
 This product was received. I didn't expect the strings to be broken with the first time I installed them. I've had them for about a year now and will continue to use them.
 This item is exactly what I needed. We've had several of the top of the line of drums and this is a good price. Very well made and functional.
 This is a great product for the price. I love it.
 Great product
 I am very happy with this product. I've had it for a year and are working great. It really is not expensive but it is for the price you can get it!
" I use this for my electrics. The straps are pretty rigid and well constructed, but I like the color coding on the neck of the guitar."
 Very accurate and accurate.
" I have a guitar and guitar that just has a bit more expensive in-out than I have. The bridge is much better than the strings that came with it. The strings are also more mellow. The strings are not that thick, but they are not as thin and are better. I don't expect too much out of these strings. They are a bit pricey, but they won't cost far. I'm not paying for these strings."
 I am a beginner in a band I am very satisfied with and I am very pleased with this purchase.
 great!
 Love these strings.
 Just what I needed
" This is a good product for the price. It has a nice, warm tone and stays in tune. The only thing I can say about it is the one that I have found.  If you want a cheap way to improve your guitar sound is a great pedal."
 Excellent
" I'm a guitar player and the sound was good on my son's guitar and amp.  It was a nightmare to install, and when I plugged it it in, I was not happy.  After reading the reviews, I'm happy with the purchase and the price."
 This does not work. It is not a true model. I plan to be able to use it for a few days.
 I've had these for over a year now and I'm glad I'm so glad they have a great sound.
 This strap is a joy and well worth its price.  I would recommend this highly to anyone looking for a quality strap that would go with or sell a guitar.
" I'm not an expert, but I'd say I'd like to pay some money for a different guitar.  I'm glad I bought this guitar."
" These are great strings, they are the best out there. I have no idea but they are extremely reliable and they sound great. I love the sound."
 It works well
" This recorder is a great deal. The sound is great and the sound quality is great. The only problem I have is that the sound is not clear.
All the other things I have with it is that there is no place for the sound system. I would not have kept it for the first time, but it's still a problem."
 Great product
 I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it.  I am an adult and I am no pro and she is happy with it.  She can't believe this is a great product for her!
 The sound is nice and clear and sounds great.  The price is reasonable.
 Not a lot to say about.
 Perfect
 I just got this one and it looks great. I love it. I don't know what I'm doing. I've been using it for a while and it has been working out great.
 Very sturdy. I bought this to use in a small room and it fits well. I use it for my video camera mic.
 I am very pleased with these!
 The sound is very clear.  The package was not a big deal!  The product was not in the best way.  I'm a little hesitant though.  But hey was some really high quality and I have to buy another one for my next gig.
" I'm a band teacher and I can't get rid of my problems.  I don't know how to do it but I'm still a musician and I've never had issues.  It is a good price, and so far I've been a great purchase, and it has yet been working out great.  I think it is a solid buy for anyone."
 This product was shipped on time and works great on my guitar.
 I am very pleased with this item and will not order it again.
 very good product
 I purchased this pedal for my 4 year old son and he loves it. He has the guitar for his first time but it is not exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
 I was looking for a guitar that I would not have to buy. This guitar looks great! The sound is very nice. The action is more accurate. I'm using this as a starter guitar.
" I'm not a pro, but I'm a professional and I'm happy with it.  The sound is good, I'm not a professional musician, but for what I'm not paying for the right, and it does the job as well.  It is a good price.  Good quality and quality, but not great."
 Great strap!
 This is a great product.
" Very sturdy strap, and very comfortable to use. I have a Strat and a Strat and a guitar strap that I keep it from breaking in so I can fit a Strat and a Les Paul.

I would highly recommend this strap for anyone with a budget, or a seasoned guitar player, or if you're looking for a strap that looks like a vintage guitar, or a guitar."
 I bought this for my granddaughters and her granddaughters.  It is a real deal.  She loves it.  I've made a video in a music store.  The sound is great.  I'm a professional player and we play around and this is a great instrument.
 It came in a timely manner and a great price.
 I use this for my daughter's first time.  It was shipped in a timely manner.  They was shipped in the mail.  This is an easy to use and the price was right.  I have a granddaughters kr-7 kr-7 and a kr-7 in the morning and we can see the difference.  Good quality.  The price is right.
" I'm a professional audio engineer, so I have bought this to use with my home studio. I have had a few computers, but I don't like the sound quality of this unit. I'm thinking about this purchase and hope to find it out."
 Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it
" Great. I'm satisfied with the quality of the product. I'm pleased with the sound quality of the guitar and the quality of the purchase. The only thing I can say is how the strings are supposed to be and in my opinion, is that the strings will come out of tune when I first started using to set it up.

I'm not sure what it would be to do... I don't know how I know how to understand the instructions are to do a review, but I did figure out the basic basic directions I had to download it for. I don't think this is a problem. I'm not so impressed with this for the price! I can't go to anyone with a guitar that won't know about guitars, but I hope to learn to play."
 I bought this for my 4yr old daughter and she is a band. It is a great deal.
" It does what it was intended. I can't even get it when I'm not playing it.  I don't know what it is, but I'm not sure what I had to do.  It is not so it was a gift.

I was hoping it was a gift but I knew that was the wrong!"
" It is a great product.  I use this pedal too, and it is not the cheap one that came with my board.  I think it is worth every penny.  I wish we had bought a used one that had a different color.

The reason I say I am a bit satisfied with this purchase was that the thing is the only reason I didn't.  It was the right size and that is not a problem.  So far it works very well.  I have no complaints about the product.  It appears to be of good quality."
 This is a great strap for the price.  It is sturdy and the price was much less than I expected.
 This is the first cymbal I got before it was a real deal.
" Great strings, I'm a beginner and they are my go to strings. I bought a pair of these strings, they sounded great, and they sound great. Great product."
 I was a little hesitant but for the price I wouldn't get a better product.  For me this is the best product i've ever tried.
 I've had this for years and I will definitely get one.
 This is the best pedal that I bought it for. It has a great sound and the price was very reasonable I paid.
 bought this item
 Great value!
" Not very well made, but not as good."
 Just as described
 These strings are amazing!  They are not that comfortable as I'm not using them!  I'm not going to try a whole new string as I know.
 Good price
" Easy to use, easy to install. I like it and very well built, and it seems to be well constructed."
" I'm an electrical engineer, and this thing is perfect. I have a few guitars that I haven't had to take care of, but I am a bit surprised. I can put in a guitar amp, but this would be a must, because it is the most useful amp for anyone."
 Excellent
 Easy to install. Just what I needed for the money.
 This product works perfectly for my guitar and guitar.
 I have had a lot of stuff that I have owned.  I'm a professional musician and this thing has been my choice.
" Great product and great price.
I bought this mic for my daughter who has a great microphone."
" This is the best and the price is about $30 at a music store. I don't expect it to be a $30 deal deal breaker, but I am satisfied with it."
 I've used this product on a guitar and it's a great deal. I know I'll get used to it as a gift.
 Perfect
" I'm a professional pianist, and I'll probably be playing for a few years.  I'm not at a music store, or it's a lot of fun to play with.  The digital tuner is easy, the only thing I don't like is they're not adjustable to tune.  I don't know if it is going to be that easy.  But for what I paid I bought it, I know the instrument is not going to play it as a tuner and not.  But this tuner is not going to go.  I know I'm going to try to play it, or I just can't really get it right.  I'm using it as a tuner for the second time I'm not an expert.  I'm not a fan of the tuner.  I did have to say that I'm so glad I did!  It is a good tuner for both the price and the quality is perfect for all my bass and basses.  The only thing I can say is what I didn't like about this tuner, but I don't like it.  I'm not a big guy but I'm not going to go to it and"
" You can't go wrong with this interface. I have had this before, and I was using it for years."
 great
 i bought this item for my Grandson! it is the right size for his guitar! it is a great product and i will continue playing this item.
" This is a great beginner's guitar. The neck is a little high and the neck is beautiful. The guitar is very inexpensive. The only bad thing i have was i can say is: the headstock is the neck, but it's not so tight. The base is a full body and I'd say it holds the neck in the neck, and the nut is not. The neck is a bit high, but it is very flexible. The neck is great, and it's cheap. The neck is adjustable, which is very nice in person, and the neck is great. The finish is a little flimsy, but it does look nice.
The neck is easy to adjust, but it's perfect for a beginner."
 It is amazing but not really. It works as advertised and i can play all the music.
" This is a great strap in between a guitar and a guitar and guitar.  The strap is very well made and the straps are very comfortable.  It is just a plain strap.  The strap is very comfortable and the strap is pretty comfortable.  I have a guitar and this strap is a big ""gibson"" strap and I am really impressed.  I really like this strap in a small room.  The strap is very comfortable to wear and take a little bit of long to get to the strap is comfortable.  Although I would not expect this strap for a price, it is a great buy."
 The best strings I've ever played!!
" i have a set of these strings, and i will try the phosphor bronze strings"
 Works great!
" I'm always motivated, and I'm a beginner. The piano is perfect but isn't as convenient as I had to be. I'm glad to say this is a good value for the product."
 Very happy with this purchase.  The sound is good you can't beat it!
 Great item at a great price
 The product is not as good as it is. This way I have to purchase one for my daughter.
 Good product.
 I just got this to use as a practice session. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be purchasing another one.
 Good
" I was a bit nervous when I first got it, but it was the best.  I think if there is a bad quality product, but it is not.  So far I'm satisfied with it."
 I'm a professional guitarist and I didn't want to spend a lot of money for one mic. This was a gift for my 7 year old son.
 Good
" I bought this pedal for my 7 year old son and he loves it.  It is a great delay pedal for a beginner.  It has a nice sound, but not very loud.  It is a great price for a pedal.  It is a great value for a very good price."
 Good sound
 Good product
 I'm a musician and I play with others.  I decided I could improve and rewind that I don't have to tune.  I used to plug it in and it in and it is fun.  And it is a fun metronome.  I can use it every day and if you're going to play or go with it is a great metronome for you.
" I like it, but it does not fit my Martin E1.  I'm hoping it will fit this instrument better."
 I bought this set for my 1st strums and is a great deal.
 The item was exactly what I was looking for.  Good service.  The product is a very durable cord that is just what I needed it for.  The package was shipped quickly.  The cord that connects it to the amp and my amp would be a nice bonus.  I will say that it was a great deal.
 Just what I was looking for.
 This is a fine tuner for the price.
 I purchased this for my granddaughters and she is thrilled with it.
 Great strings.
 I've played this over the years I've used this pedal.
 Great product. Thank God for a very quick shipping
 This is the best strap ever!  It is a very well made strap that will last for years.
 I'm not a professional musician and this is the best way to get the job done. I love the sound quality and the convenience of this instrument. It's fun to play the guitar! I'm just going to love it. I'm a beginner so I don't be sure if I'm doing the right job. I'm not a professional and I'm not expert on guitar playing. I'm hoping this is the best guitar I've ever had and it's so good!
" I have a large room for my Yamaha keyboard, and it fits my Yamaha keyboard nicely.  The keyboard is small enough to fit my keyboard.  I love the keyboard.  The keyboard is heavy enough to fit my Yamaha keyboard.
  The keyboard is easy to use but I would recommend it if you're looking for a keyboard for a friend."
 I got this for my husband and he loves it
 Good quality.  Very well made and fits for my Gibson HK.
" Easy to install, looks good quality.  The sound quality is great on the low end.  This was perfect"
 This amp is perfect for my church praise band.
 I bought this cable and got it for a friend. The cord is great and the cord is the perfect solution for my son.
 Great product
" I am a big fan of this microphone, and it was a great deal, and I love it all!"
 I own this pedal and my old Behringer pedal board. I was looking to learn to play this pedal. So far it works great
" The picture that you get is very ""geat"" with ""geat"" on your guitar.  I looked for it and it was perfectly.  I had no idea what I was doing.  I was looking at the guitar store and it was perfect.  The picks are great and the ""geat"" is totally functional.  The only problem I have was I have was in the ""out"" section, and in the book that I bought this product.  They were not a piece of garbage.  But it is a great price for a guitar pick.  It was a very good deal."
" Great product, delivered fast and I don't know how to use it. I like it so much. It is a good value and shipping was quick."
 I'm new to guitar and this is my first strap and it has great features.
 I've had this stand for a few years and it works great.
 I bought this to use with my Korg keyboard and it works great.  I am satisfied with the quality of its purchase.  I would recommend this product.
 I agree with these. They're not what I'm looking for.
" Great product, great service."
" I like this strap, but I won't get the same price in my opinion.

I'll agree with the other reviewers.
I was extremely impressed with the quality of it.

I'm not happy with it, but it seems like they are going to take some care of the difference.

I won't try it with nylon & steel."
" I got a stand that was better than my one I was hoping.  I am not going to buy it, but it works well and can be adjusted.  I am happy with the purchase."
 It works great.
" I'm a beginner, and I'm not really expert, but I'm playing with this particular model to start. I bought this as a gift to my teenage granddaughters.  It's a quality instrument and the sound quality is very good.  A bit fragile but not expensive.  I don't know how it holds up.  But for the price you can't beat this.  It will be a fun instrument for you."
 It's the perfect pick. I've had it for 6 months and it still works as advertised.
 The strings that came with the guitar were dead in the first week and I am not going to buy again!
" The bag is not long enough for the price and the price is excellent. The bag is not long enough to fit a banjo.

It is a bit snug for me to carry my guitar (I don't have to play) to a gig or travel with it, and it's a bit snug either. The bag is not made for a gig bag that I was hoping to be. If you are looking for a bag for travel and playing a gig bag for traveling or travel, then this bag will have to be for you."
" The sound is great, the sound is great, and the price is right."
 This metronome is perfect for the price
 This is a wonderful product in my opinion. I've owned this microphone for years. I don't hear my voice without an amp. I plugged it in and it worked. I noticed a slight difference. I also plugged it in and it worked very well. I can't believe I was using this mic and it worked great.
" I've had this for a few years. I'm not a fan of the stuff, but very nice to have."
 I really like these strings.  They have a bright mellow tone and durability.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to try a high end and save up and get a great deal.
 I recently bought to save a few dollars when they came to date.  They worked very well and my daughter loves them.
 I got this to use with the mic. The mic is built like a tank and I like that it is not good for the price.
 Love these.
 Great quality strings.  Nice and bright enough to hold my guitar and other acoustic guitar.
 The guitar is fine and does not fit the headstock and neck.
" I don't understand what I was ordering from Amazon.  I thought that I was going to try a different brand of product.  It's not going to fit my guitar, and it will fit into my wall.  It's about 1/2 inch diameter.  The guitar is great quality and looks wonderful.  I play it in every way.  It won't fit any guitar, but it looks like it was made by a soft black.  The thing that to say is a really good product (I can't be wrong)."
 Works perfect!!
 nice
 Great product for the price.
" I have one of these for now.  It's a very good product, and it is well made, and it's a good price."
" This is a great product; however, the sound was not the right sound. I don't know any complaints about it, but it was not what I expected."
" I've loved Ernie Ball strings, but I had to say that Ernie Ball strings were the best out there."
 I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!
 I have been playing guitar for over a year now and they are still my favorite.
 This product is not heavy enough for sheet music. I use it for sheet music and my music stand.
 Great product!
" This product is not very good.  It is not exactly what I was looking for.  It is good for a small person who says ""This is a good product"
" I put this on my Gibson SG. The pickup was defective. I have to send the guitar out. I don't know how to just screw it in and it was all about the problem. The nut is too short to fit the guitar. The bridge was not the guitar I installed a guitar, but I thought something was going into and out of the box. I was wrong. The neck was not deep, and I was not really liking it. The neck was warped. I thought it had a neck that didn't fit it on the guitar. The neck was too narrow and I was wrong, and it was a nightmare. I looked at the other pictures of this and the guitar was a little hard to install and I'm not going to get it. But that is a problem with this guitar."
" I love this strap, it looks amazing!  I'm not playing guitar, but this strap is a great strap for the price."
" Great product, I bought this for my teenage boy. It is very sturdy."
 This is a great product and works as expected.
 It works great and it worked great.
 I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.
" It does everything I expected to do.  I needed an adapter for my Furman turntable.  I didn't like this because I am not very careful with the ""stylus"" plugging the bass through the amp, but it works perfectly."
" I bought this product, and it was the best for the price. I love the fact that this was a real product and I love it."
" This is a great product, and I'm sure it will last a long time.  I'm a fan of this product and I am very pleased."
 very good
 Excellent price! I love this little box for my 2nd hand guitars and this is a great little box. I do recommend this product.
 This is exactly what I needed to get.  It works great but not for me.
 I'm not a fan and would not buy this. It has a nice sound and good sound that is more accurate.
" I bought this guitar from a local music store where I found a similar to the one pictured for the price.  I am in a high school band and this guitar has a good price.  I would definately say that it's a great guitar and it sounds great!  I'm just learning to play the guitar that I have had, but I am just learning to play the guitar and this guitar was a great piece.  I don't know why I paid more than this guitar for it, but it's a really good deal.  It's a great deal and I've had it for a few months now and it's still a perfect guitar.  I'm happy with the purchase."
" The product.  Very good quality, and I'm satisfied with the quality."
 I got this for my son and he loves it.  This was the first one that we purchased.  The price was right.  The product is a small size for a small size guitar.  It fits into his case and his guitar is protected.  It's not meant for a small size guitar guitar.  The guitar is just a little short for the price but I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase.
 Works perfectly
" I bought this for my boyfriend, who is a professional musician and he is very pleased."
 I got this for my 3rd grader.  It is good product and got it in a timely manner.  Very well made.  Would recommend this for any musician who has a problem.
 I have been using this for a few years and it works great.
 This pick was missing in the picture. If you are looking for a pick that is exactly what you need.
 I bought two of these for use. They work good but I can't get that thing.
 I purchased this for my daughter. She loves it! It is not worth the money.
 I bought this item to keep my guitar in and out of tune.  It is very well made.  The sound quality is great.  It has done a fantastic job of keeping a guitar in tune.  I am glad I have bought it.
 I like it better than my mic headset mic.
 I love it. The strap is adjustable and I don't have to make it so.
" If you're a guitar player, you won't be sorry. I really like the sound of this strings. But when you play, you can't go wrong with this strings. Very nice, but not all of them."
 I love the sound...
" I bought this product because I had a Yamaha YPG-235D, and am glad to find this product. I recommend this system for anyone who is planninging this thing."
 This string broke two of the first strings.  it is not the strings i installed.  it would play on a bass player but I didn't like the sound of the strings.  I would not recommend this string.
" I got the Hosa GTR-106 Molded Guitar Case for Standard Kits,..."
 Good sound and price!
 I love this pedal.  The only pedal I bought is the pedal.  I'm sure I'll get a beat to it.
 Good quality.
" I bought this item as my one time. Works just fine, and great price"
" i got this, and it works perfect. my kids love it!"
 Love the sound quality....
 I bought this item because it was a high quality amp. It is the same thing I have found a very reasonable price.
" This is the best wall hanger hanger hanger. It's great to install. I'm not sure what I can say about it, but I think it will work well, and I love it!"
 Very good for the price!
 Great product!
" I had to return it.  It is terrible but it is a bad microphone.  I had to return it.  It's NOT a quality microphone, it is not worth $30.  I know.  I don't think you will have this issue.  I am not happy with this one so I am just not paying $10 for a refund."
 Great
 Very good.
" The price was easy for me.  I'm not disappointed.  The strings are strong, and they last a little longer and sound the best. I can definitely tell you that the strings are very good.  I've not used them on the basses but for me it you, this is a great deal.  If you plan to play with you will like me, so it's a bad deal.  Good!"
 This is a great strap and can be given a very nice strap to have for gigs without bothering the stage.
 This is exactly what I expected it to be. I would recommend  this to anyone who wants to learn to play an instrument.
 I love the sound quality of this. I am very satisfied with the quality of this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to invest in the audio quality.
 Beautiful strap and great quality
 Excellent
" I have a Gibson SG and I am glad I bought it and will be buying this guitar. The guitar is a bit smaller. The neck is a bit wider but I am very pleased with it. The bass is perfect for an inexpensive guitar. The neck is very high quality. The neck is great. The neck is a bit small, but it's still comfortable. The neck is solid, but it's an inexpensive guitar.

The neck is a very good choice for this guitar. The guitar is a good deal, but not great. The neck is much better, but the action is not comfortable for the price. There are no flaws in the neck, but I'm not sure if the neck is a little wider. The neck is really comfortable to play, but it's not a deal breaker, but I can tell it would be a good travel guitar. I would buy it again."
 I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She loves it. I love the sound quality.
 These are my go to strings.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The price was right.
 Great product.
 Great value
 I bought this thinking about buying a new reed and got it. I know that it is a good product.
" The product is not the right size, but it's very cute. The product is great."
 This is a great guitar! It has a great feel and sound. It is small enough for an adult learner or a child.
 I think they sound like they are a little pricey but I am very satisfied with these.
 The product description is a negative product it says
 I've worked with many tuner's for over a year now and I must say I like this tuner. I am pretty glad I did.
 I'm a musician and I'm not very satisfied.  I've never had the problem and I don't know anything about this product.  I am a professional musician and I live in a home.  I'm a professional musician and I live in my office.  I can't ask for anything more.  The quality is much better than my old portable unit which was not recommended.  I've had this for about 6 months now and it's still working for me.
 Arrived on time and in good condition.
" it works great, it's super cheap, it works great."
 I bought this item for my son and he loves it! The quality is good and the price should be reasonable for a beginner's!
 I was very pleased.
" I've used this microphone for my church band, and I can tell for a great sound quality.  I use it every day.

The sound quality is pretty good.  The mic is great for the price.  The price is excellent, and I'm happy with it."
" The strap is not comfortable though, it won't hurt me."
 I have had these for a year now and they worked well.  They look awesome and the price is right.
 I'm a guitar teacher.  I love these strings.  The accessories are not as high quality as you would expect them to be.  I'm sure they don't last longer than my local store was shipped out of the package.
 Excellent
 I bought this strap for my 7th one and it works great.  It was shipped and it was exactly what I needed.  I'm sure it is made well and I got it when I needed it.
" I'm a huge fan of this product. The cable is great and the connectors are not the ""too high in between the two."
" I bought this set to use in a rehearsal studio.  I had no complaints about the product, but it was fast shipping."
 The best tuner I've ever owned. I would buy again.
" I can say that this is a great machine.  It makes my son feel more natural.  If you need to be a beginner or advanced or a beginner, you will save you a good buy!!"
" I was hoping for my first tuner but it was not!  The one I was actually using was a hassle.  I found one on a web site in the music store to store and I was glad to get it.  I really don't know how to use the ""on button"" button on the tuner.  I am not sure what I did, but I am not sure what I'm doing.  I found that I don't like the sound, but it is not a really accurate tuner.  I had to say that this tuner does what it is supposed to, but it is perfect.  The only thing being said, is it's a little pricey but you won't find it for the price...  I think if you're looking for an inexpensive pedal to help you know what I'm doing.  If you are looking for an inexpensive pedal pedal pedal that I recommend this one.  It's all about any pedal that makes you need to have if you are looking for a tuner and you can get it here.  It has a great features for tuners."
 I like these strings.
" I got it. I am learning to play, and it is perfect. I am very pleased."
" Good quality, great price."
 I use this windscreen for windscreen screens.
" The sound quality is good. The sound is good at under $12. I haven't used it yet, but it sounds nice. I'm glad I bought it, but I'm glad I did."
 Love these strings.  They are a bit pricey but worth every penny.
 Works great!
 For my daughter's band she can easily pick this with her clarinet. She likes it so much!
" Great price. If you plan on your guitar and you have a hard time to play guitar, this is a great deal."
 This product was exactly what I expected. No problems but I guess I'll take it apart.
" I know, but it's not so heavy.  It's an awesome case for the price I paid.  I'm an electrical engineer and they're in my opinion.  I'm a big guy and I'm not sure what to say, but I don't know what I'm doing and I've had this case for about a year."
 it works great
 I bought this item because I was just not expecting it to be that expensive
 I am using this keyboard for my music class and it works great!
 I love this product...
" I got this as a gift for my 6-string.  Its good, great price."
" I am a ""slots"" player. It works well, it's a great price."
 This is the best pedalboard pedal board.
 Great product!
" This is a great product...it would have to buy another one...a little more expensive, but it does the job very well."
" Great product, great price."
" This thing is a great guitar! I'm not sure what to say about this guitar, but it works great. I know I'm going to get a great one too."
" I use them on my electrics acoustic, and they hold up very well."
 I bought this for my daughter and she is absolutely thrilled.
 The sound and feel of Ernie Ball strings is the best out there.  I have used them for over twenty years.  They last a long time and are very durable.  I don't know how long or short they will last.  But they have a tendency to play daily.  I don't think the strings will last longer than any other strings.  They don't need to be expensive.  They don't break as far as far as long as Ernie Ball has been on the market.  But if they need something I will definitely buy something else from here.
 Arrived on time. Perfect.
" The sound is great, but the strings were loose.  I used several different strings."
 Great
" Very well made, well made and fits perfectly.  Very well made and was totally functional.  Easy to use."
" Very good price, great product"
 This is a great product and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good product.
 I was looking for a good product and it was a great price.
 This product is exactly as described. Good quality and the price is reasonable.
" I love this mic.  I am in love with this microphone, and for the price i cant find out that i can buy one one of those cheaper mics for the price, and i'm glad i found this one."
 I am a beginner and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
 I am using this for my daughter's music class.  She is a musician and she says it has a pretty good sound quality.  She has a very good quality and she can't go wrong with it.
" This looks great, is a perfect design and is well constructed. Good price."
" I needed this for my Yamaha digital piano.  It was exactly what I was looking for, I don't know why.  It's a great metronome."
" I am a novice, and I'm not a professional player. But I am not a professional musician and I am glad I did. I plan on replacing my strings with the higher quality strings, but I'd not find the best in the world. I've found the strings still work very well. The strings sound great, and I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but I think that is due to the strings. This is a good buy for anyone who has a good idea."
" I love the sound quality of the sound quality. And, I have a spare set of these.
I recommend these. They are the best and they are my favorite!"
" I purchased this to protect my Gibson Les Paul, and it works great with a Stratocaster."
 I use the same pickup to pick up my electric guitar.  The product is very well constructed and fast shipping costs.  I would not recomend this item.
 i bought this as a gift. i got it as a gift and i love the colors for the price. i am so glad i bought this.
" Excellent product, and quality."
" I'm a beginner and this was my first time and I'm happy. I'm glad I found this product from Amazon, and is really very happy with it."
 I bought this for my 9 yr old son and it is just what he needed.  The metronome is easy to operate and we will be using it for a friend.  I don't have to spend money for it because it's a metronome.  It is a great metronome!
 Good
" works as described, just what I expected"
 The best guitar ever.  It is exactly what I expected.
" I was expecting a quality mic that was so low quality, but it was not, and not a good purchase.  I ordered a pair of those and they're not good.  I'm a newbie with the Tascam and a little bit more expensive.  I don't know how to use this mixer for anything."
" Very well constructed, and they work well. I love them"
 Exactly what I needed and will buy again!
 I like these reeds.  It's a good price and the price is reasonable.  They don't get rid of it!  Get one for a!
 My daughter love it!
 This is a great windscreen for the price you can find at the music store.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try this windscreen for or anything.
 Perfect
 This was the best deal!
 Great product.
" I bought this to use a mic that was not so great. It really does the job, but I'm not going to buy this one. I don't know how it compares to a mic, but it is really great mic."
 This is exactly what I was looking for. It comes with 4 and I have no problem with it.
" I'm a mobile DJ and I need a home studio monitors.  So far I like these speakers and they're all together very well, just plug them in and listen.  They sound amazing to wear.  One thing I can say about these speakers is they are very well made"
 I was looking for a new guitar. I have a Gibson Les Pauls and I am very satisfied with the sound. Great bass guitar for the price. I got it. I've never had it for a while and it looks great!
 I decided to try this windscreen for me because it was great. The windscreen was so thin and it was not worth $15.
" Works great, I did not like it."
 The sound is so beautiful. It only has a few things I may improve.
" I have had this mic for several years and it sounds incredible. The only reason I give it 5 is because the sound is the mic and I don't have to spend as much as I have to say. I don't know how it compares with other microphones.

I've owned it for about two years and it is the best one of all for the price. I've owned them and is still working.

I can say that I will never have to buy another for any other microphone, but here is am I, and I don't know how to do this for anyone who has been on a budget."
" I'm not sure what to say.  My only complaint is that it is not ""a direct plug"" and ""it's not"" the USB out.  I could have a USB cable with a USB cord but I don't see anything better.  I have a Yamaha keyboard and a Yamaha keyboard with a USB cord.  I use it for my purpose.  I have a Yamaha keyboard and keyboard and it works perfectly.  I can use it for my purpose."
 great
" I know this product is a great product, and I will update."
 I love this unit.  It is perfect for the price.
 Great and I am quite satisfied with this product.  Great price.
" I'm a professional pianist (i, and i) and i'm not an audiophile.  I'm using this for my keyboard and i can tell you that it's actually well done, and for the price.  No problems, no problems."
 I bought this for my boyfriend and the daughter loves it! It came in a timely manner for Christmas!
 I bought this for my daughter who is a musician she loves it.
 I have this on my guitars and it is perfect for my acoustic guitar.
" Just as described, what more can you ask for? If you're looking for something that will last for you you years and you won't get a bad one in the future."
 Love these picks
" This metronome is exactly what I wanted it for. I'm playing the piano, and we are very pleased."
 Great
 Great product
 Good picks
 These are great!  I will buy again.
 This product makes my guitar sound amazing.  It's a good buy!
 Works.
 I was looking for a tuner for my guitar. I figured this tuner was the one I received and was it's perfect. It works perfectly and is easy to use.
" This tuner was recommended for me and sounds great! I'm using this to tune my violin, and it works perfect. I use it to tune my electric guitar and it works perfectly."
" This tuner is the best tuner that I have ever used. I'm a big fan of tuners, and I can tell you I have received this in a very reliable way."
 I needed a new bow to avoid the hassle of changing strings. The bow is great.
 Does it really? No complaints!
 great!
 It's a great amp for the price. The amp is a good amp for the price. The amp is a very good one for the price. The amp has a nice amp. The amp is great for the price. The amplifier is very well constructed. But not great for those who are looking for a little better. The amp is a bargain at $100 the price.  It's a great amp for the price. The amp is good for the price.
" I ordered this product from the company to a friend who is an electrical engineer for his.  He has a classical guitar which he is not going to.  The guitar is a high quality and it is a great deal.  The strings are all we needed, so we bought a new one of these.  This is a good product for beginners, and he is a happy customer."
 I bought this because it was a gift. He said he wanted to learn to play.  The music was great.  I was very pleased.  I don't know how to play it.  But he will say he is a very good beginner's music teacher.
 Great strings.
" I bought this bag for my daughter. The bag is a little pricey, but it does fit my guitar perfectly."
" The best strings I have ever used. They don't last a long time, and they're still holding up for me."
 I bought this item for a granddaughters daughter and she was thrilled to see her music teacher has the same thing. I'm a music teacher so I am so glad to learn to play. I love this stand and will buy it anytime soon.
 I like the sound of both strings. Very mellow and flexible. I like the bright and mellow sound
" This mic has a good sound quality for the price.  I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or not, but I have to say it is a good one.  I hope it would help to improve my mic setup."
 great price
 I bought this for my church band.
 I love this metronome. It is a great metronome for this price!
 Just what I needed.
 Exactly what I wanted.
" I keep my favorite strings, I keep them.  I've used them with any type of string and I have never had to tune it.  I know on most of the strings, they will do the job.  I've used them for about 10 years and I can say that's the best strings for me.  I don't know how they're supposed to sound or feel.  I've used them for about 6 months now."
" I bought this for my 5yr old son's size guitar bag.  The bag is not the same quality as the one I was not expecting for the price.  It is the worst bag I have ever found and it is so expensive I am worried about dropping a guitar in a closet, but no problems.  The zippers don't fit the guitar with the bag so it is going from the bag if it didn't fit out so it doesn't fit it very well.  I'm not going to throw it in a case or something but it was not so big and bulky.  The bag is a piece of garbage.  It's just not for a gig bag and it is a great bag!"
" This is perfect for the price. The only thing that is there is is about this is because it is just in my opinion, it is not the case."
 Very good product and product...
 The item was exactly what I was looking for. I was a bit hesitant but it does the job.
 i've had one for a year now. i love it
 Excellent product.  I would get this product from Amazon!  Highly recommended.
 The Korg Pitchblack Chromatic Tuner is a very good tuner. Highly recommended.
 I've been using this for about a year now and it is the best to anyone in a way.
" Easy to install, and it works great."
 I am a huge fan of this.  I am very happy with this purchase!
 Great value for price.
 I'm not a good company and this company definitely works GREAT!!!!!!
" I'm a bit hesitant with the device but I was very satisfied with the sound quality of the product.  My only complaint is the noise is so clear.  The problem is it's a toy.  The hum was not worth $10.  The battery was a major issue.  The problem was that we have to be a little quieter.  It was the problem because it was not the amp.  Maybe I'm not going to say  I'm going to have the power supply on my amp.  The problem is the amp only.  However, it was a very nice thing.  I know but I don't think you can get a bad one for those people, but I'm a little wrong.  But for anyone who's just starting out in public, you will probably find the best solution."
 Good quality
 Great product and I would recommend this product.
" I use it every day and it works very well.  No reason I had to buy this unit is to be a musician's toy for anyone who has one wanting to buy this item.  If you are looking for a portable tuner, this is a great purchase.  It's a bargain and should cost me for a true bypass tuner."
 It is great. It would be 5 stars but I won't try it for a gig.
 This is a very good product. It is a good price for what ukuleles. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn and is just a beginner.
" For a great tuner or just one tuner, this works.  It does the job and is easy to use."
 This is a pretty good quality guitar!
 Good price
 Love these picks.
 My guitar teacher recommended these strings for beginners.  They are my favorite and they seem to last longer than any other brands.
 I bought these for my son for Christmas. He loves them and says they are holding up and running. The reed was a gift to him.
" This item is very cheap, and you can't spend $15 for it."
 These are the best strings for the price
 Behringer is a great price
" I'm new to guitar, so I don't know about guitars very well. This guitar looks good to have."
 Excellent!!
 It works great for a price.
" I like the sound. I love the ""medium"" sound."
 This is a perfect product for the price!
 This is my first one of these microphones. I have used it for a few years now and I am still very impressed.
 I love the strap for the price.  I have a Yamaha PX-S Custom and will be more comfortable for me.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a strap for his guitar.
 This is a super great product.
 I don't believe what I paid for. Good product.
 The strap is high quality and the price was super.
 Very good quality for the price!
 These are great. They work great. I was a little worried but you won't find any problems with these items.
"  its like a tank, it is a really well made.  I would recommend the pedal to anyone who is looking for a great delay pedal.  It will take you a while to find the best delay pedal pedals out there, but it is definitely a bargain.  i like it and it is not going to look at the shop for the least for the price."
 I really like these strings
" This is a very good product, but to my surprise, it was a waste of money!  This is a great product if you want to learn to play it.  I am very happy with it and will be ordering another for the future!

I'm no musician who is planning on learning to play with this instrument.  It is a wonderful quality, and sounds amazing.  I am not sure what I have read yet, but I am pretty satisfied with it."
 No problems.
" The best bass strings. The strings are easy to install and the strings are comfortable to wear. The strings are easier to install, and the sound quality is great. The strings are not prone to peel or play. The strings are more rigid, I will try the Ernie Ball strings."
" I don't think this is a great product.  I don't think it is going to be the best part of the world.  I'm glad I found a different cord length.  I'm not sure what to do with a different cord length cord, but I am just glad I have bought this cord."
" The best for the price.

I bought this pedal and it works very well.  It has a sweet sound from my amp."
 very good stand and can't go wrong!
" Good quality, very well made and sturdy. I am glad I did."
" I'm a professional musician and I am the pro-intermediate musician. It is a great deal, and it is perfect for a beginner learner."
 Just as described and in well made
 Great product.  Good price!
" This cable is just what I wanted. It is more expensive, but better than I expected."
 Perfect
 I love this product and it is a great product!
" It works nicely, and it is worth the price!"
 I was looking for a tuner that was not working on my guitar. This product was no surprise. I am very satisfied with this machine.
" This is a great product for the price you get. It came exactly as described, but it was not the one pictured. I am happy to find out what I did."
 I love this cord.  It is a good quality cord.  I have 3 and 2 and it serves it's purpose.  The cable is easy to handle and the length is a plus.  I've used it for over a year now and it is still working.  The cord is not long enough to be a problem.  It is a good price cord and will buy again.
 I am very pleased with these straps. They are very comfortable and they look and play. The zippers are very well made.
 Just as described.
 Very well made and sturdy.
" I'm not using this for my home studio so I'm not a pro.  I use this for my home studio.  The sound quality is excellent.  If you are an audiophile's, I would probably opt for a better one, but if you plan on using a more expensive model of this model at a music store.  Do not have to buy this one because of the other reviews."
 Great product! Thanks!
 Good price!
" Easy to use, reasonably priced, and in between with a cord."
" This Rack Stand is perfect. I don't know what I am doing with it, but it works great.  We use it to stack it up.  I recommend it for all of my gear.  It's even better than its a good one at a music store.  The only beef that I can say about this product is the quality of the price of this product is that the screws are not screwed into the wall if you want to throw a wall it around.  The quality of this product is the only rack part that holds it up should work with it.  The only thing I would say is what I don't say about it is is that it is?  I'm thinking about."
" The keyboard is very well made, but I'm not expecting it to cost a little more, but it's a well made keyboard for the price."
" The best bang for the buck, the price was right for me, I'm not sure how durable it is, but I'm glad I did. I'm a little worried about this brand. I'm not sure what I'm doing, but I am glad I did."
 Excellent product!
 Works as advertised
 Very happy with these. The wall wall anchors were on the wall. I got one for them and they work.
 Good product and great price
 Arrived on time and perfect quality!
 I was looking for a power adaptor for my Gibson P-45. This one is a good price.
 works well
 Excellent
" I bought this cartridge for my son's turntable and we was surprised.  The low price was low, but we were very pleased with this."
" I bought this item for my son.  It is the same as one.  The adapter is really thin, but his amp doesn't come with it."
 I bought this as a gift to my 9 yr old daughter and she loves it.
 I bought this for my grandson who is an intermediate player. It was exactly what we needed.
 it is perfect.
 I'm a beginner's guitar playing guitar and I'm a beginner and these things are the best!
 it was exactly what I was expecting.
 I can't believe it is an excellent product.  I use this to record on my pc.  I think that it should have worked as well as my PC.
 I got this for my niece and she loves it.
" Good product, very well made, and very satisfied."
" This is the best reed I've ever got.  It's pretty cool, especially for what we needed it for."
 This is a great value for the price. It's a good value and I recommend it.
 This metronome is a great metronome for the price.  The metronome is great and does a great job for a great price and a great value.
" The Korg nanoKEY tuner is no exception for me, however, it is not the most accurate tuner I've ever used.

I use this tuner in conjunction with a preamp tuner.  It is true bypass, and I can use it all the time, but it is the same on a guitar that I've used.  I bought this tuner for a friend, who works a lot.  She has no idea what to do with the tuner (it is accurate).  The only problem I have is that it is that it is not useful for my use.  I don't know what you can use it for.  It is a hassle to put on hand.  It does not make sense.

I like the display at all, but it makes really annoying noises for me.  I'm just not able to hear music.  I don't know how to use this other tuner!

I have the power cable included.

It is a great deal for the price!  I can't say I'm so glad I bought one for my other pedalboard."
 Good product
 Fantastic quality.
 Easy to install and easy to use.
 I bought this for my daughters first one for her christmas present. It is as described with the product.
 I've had this for about 10 years and I'm very satisfied with the quality of sound. I'm sure it's a great value too.
 I've been having to use this pedal for years.  It's a great pedal!
 I've got this item for a year and it's really good.
" The mic stand is not very sturdy, very solid.  The product description on the product page is not the item pictured.  The product description says that the product description says not and does not.  But we did not do all the other things I was writing about it.  The product description says ""I was wrong.  My item description was a microphone with the mic on the product page.  Not the product description says that this item says it is intended and will not buy it again.  The item description says it is a microphone stand and I'm disappointed.  I'm not going to return it, I am returning it.  I'm not going to buy another one.  If you plan to return it, I would have to pay a little more dollars for something like this.  I am trying to return it back.  What is stated? I'm wondering if the product is a mic stand for the price you cant buy this one. "
 The guitar is a good guitar to the price.
 The product is of very low quality. Very good price.
 Arrived on time. good price.
" I'm an amateur guitarist and I've never had a problem.
I think it's more accurate and is more accurate in between amps."
" I'm a big guy, and this thing has been amazing for a while.  I've been using a bunch of strings for a long time and I've never had one bad boy, but the D'Addario strings still work for me.  I know they are good strings for a low price.  I've never really used them for it so I can say that D's got a bad one, but I got a used one of these strings, and it was a good one.  I think this helps with any guitar that doesn't happen to your guitar, but I'm not giving 5 stars.  I would recommend these strings.  The strings are pretty bright and they look nice."
" I am using this with a Korg korg korg game.  It is easy to read and very useful.  I am amazed at the price.  I am not sure what the manufacturer says it is, and the price is reasonable.  You cannot buy this metronome, it should have a more useful metronome."
 I use this for film interviews and it's all my voice is now working great. I use it on every mic and it looks nice.
 Great product
 great sound
 Very good
 Great product
 I've used this for a few years now and I'm very happy.
" Works great, I've bought a few for a new one.  Good price"
" This product is a great product and i got a great deal!  The only problem with this product is that the guitar is not made in China!!!  It should be a bit more natural that i have never played.  I can't say I will ever try this product.  I don't like this for anything but it is awesome it will do.  If you are looking for something that will last you won't be disappointed, but it will serve you well.  I don't think you go wrong!  If you want to do this thing, then this would be the one you won't be disappointed.  The product is well constructed and does exactly what I was looking for.  I have not found any problems with this product and it is a great product.  I am 100w years old and have never had any problems.  I don't know how to play without it, but it is a good product.  I have"
 I am a guitarist and I am using this for my bass.  If I was not playing the guitar I would have found a better sound.  I like the sound of the guitar and the sound is great.  I recommend this to anyone who wants more.  If you are looking for a great sound that you can buy for this guitar.  you won't find it.  I use it as a gift to anyone.  I am extremely impressed.
 I am an electrical engineer and i found this product to be a real deal. i am quite pleased
" The product was returned, it was not the end and I didn't even know, the product was poorly made, but the seller was an absolute joke."
 Excellent
 I use this mixer to mix the guitar through my pc.
 I have a Shure SM57 and it works perfectly. The only reason I've bought this microphone is that I wish the mic got a bad switch. I think it was a good product.
" I just got this string set thinking it was going to last, and it does the job.

I really like the sound of this string. I'm thinking I can get a good tone from this string."
 I love the sound quality and the quality.
 I got these strings for my Granddaughters. The strings are just as good for a beginner.
" This item was shipped in the mail!  The product description says that it works.  The packaging is not the worst brand, but it's a toy.  But the price is about $5 dollars.  They are a little pricey but I'm glad I bought this one."
 I'm a karaoke machine and it works very well.
 I love this strap and will buy again
" I am a musician and I have used Shure 55'S for years. I use this as a gift, and it is perfect for the price."
 Great capo!  I've been playing for years and I'm very satisfied with the results.  I'll buy again.
 I am not a fan of this product. The sound quality is great and is very clear. The unit works great and the price was reasonable.
" Only strings are broken, they break in a lot of ways. This is a waste of money. Very disappointed."
" I've never had a problem with this mic. This was probably worth the money...

I bought this item for my niece for her birthday, and she loves it."
 They sound good for my grandson's guitar and he likes them.
" I am a beginner so I don't say much about D'Addario's and I'm a little bit nervous. I'm a casual pro guitarist and this is my second for bass playing. I don't know what the difference between this model. I'm not going to pick up my money at all, but I'm a little satisfied with the sound."
 This was my gift for the right size.
" It's a good stuff. I'm glad I got a better one. If you think about a plastic or flimsy plastic, it's in the way."
 I always love this guitar. It's great. I've played it for a few years and it's great!
 I purchased this for my 5 yr old son. He really loves the sound.
 I'm a Levy's strap player and this strap is the best of the quality. It's a good strap for a price price instrument.
" I was not happy with this product, and its quality is fantastic. The price was right."
" I've used this mic for about 20 years and it's still a great one.  I'm satisfied and it does exactly what I need it to.  I used it for many things.  I use it for gigs as well, and it just sounds great.  I don't know how it'll sound yet."
" I'm a professional musician and I'm a beginner. The amplifier is a great value. The amp is the best amp I've ever owned. I love it. It is a pretty loud deal, that is what i love."
 I put these on a recommendation and they worked.  I am a beginner that is a pro.  I have a high school guitar and they were perfect.  I am very pleased with them.  I still have a pair of these and they are sturdy.  I don't have any problems with them.  I love to say that these are the best strings I've ever used.
" The pick holder doesn't do what it's supposed to do, but it has very useful features.
I'm using this in conjunction with a very high quality headset headset mic, and it is a very good product."
 These are very good!  I love them.  This is a great package for any string and I have them on my guitar and they are great!
 This is a perfect product.  Very good product.
 Great strings
" The product that I received was damaged. The product was broken. It won't fit a mic, which was annoying to get it, I know it's a bad product, I'm not sure what I'm doing."
 This is by far the best guitar I have ever owned. It is a perfect size for my son.
 It works great
" Use it to beat an old school band.  I use it for the class, as the metronome is a bit bulky and is portable.  The metronome allows you to use it for music, etc.  I use it for band, and the metronome function with it in a band."
 Its a great product and I'm pleased.
 Great product. I use it daily.
 I can get the job done and it works perfectly with my wall wall.
" I am a big guy and the ""Lok"" is the best thing Ive ever owned. It is a bit pricey but it is the price is right."
 Great product

 Great strap for the price
 I bought this to use with a MXR mixer. Very well constructed and very priced.
 The strings come as advertised.  The guitar is an incredible deal.
 This product was as described and I am very happy with it.
 I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it!  She loves it and she is now learning to play the guitar!  The sound is a nice touch and even though the guitar doesn't require a tuner for her.  This is a good value for the price and I didn't expect it to be a great deal for the price!
 I like it for the price
 This is my first one!
 Great for the price
 The product was exactly what I was looking for. The product was exactly what was described.
 This is the first time I am using this mic for my voice. It's great for voice interviews and podcasts interviews.
" I've been playing professionally for years for the first time. I've been playing professionally for over 50 years, and I don't really like the sound. I have a home studio, and I'm satisfied."
 This is a great product and works well.
 I've been using this mic for almost daily and it's no exception.  It should work for me.  The price is right.  It's an easy to use mic for the price range and price is right.  I like the sound quality of this mic.
 This is a very good product. I'm a big guy and this was a gift for my daughter.
" Very good quality, great sound quality!"
 I purchased this product because I had been in my local store. The item was shipped very well from any where the packaging was not even the product. I would definitely buy this item from here.
 very cool and useful.
 Perfect
 Great
 Excellent
" I bought this item yesterday and it is the first one I purchased.  The sound is very accurate, and that's not a problem.  The sound is nice and clear, and the sound is perfect.  The only bad thing I have found is the sound quality is that the sound is way superior to the mics I've used.  The sound is very nice.  What is it?  But this is not.  I'm a bit clumsy on my own for me, and the sound quality is very good."
 I bought this guitar strap for my 3 year old and he loves it. It is very sturdy and is very comfortable. I got one for him and it really is all that one should start with it. It is a very sturdy strap that is just what I ordered. I bought this one for my 4yr old and he is a bit better one. It is really sturdy and very well made. I purchased a strap that will work for him.
 If you want to give this as a gift and you won't regret it.
 I love this product. It is very good quality strings.
 I bought this product about 2 to hang my electrics.  The installation is simple.  I have a couple of them and they are nice.  We'll see how it holds up.
" I am not so happy with this product, and I was so glad I did!"
 I use this for my electric guitar.
" This is a very good product for the price, just what I needed."
" These are the best strings I've ever used.

I've had them for over 20 years and they still work great.

I don't know how they live up as I'm concerned by a lot of people who are not familiar with Elixirs, but i just remember to be careful, your favor and buy these because they won't disappoint.
I'm a beginner in my life, and i can say that I really love these strings!"
 The strap is very good quality and I am not disappointed
 This is a great strings.  The strings have great sound and they last longer than most strings.
 I've got this for my son and he loves it.
 I got this for my granddaughters.  She loves it and she loves it so far.  I'm using it for her music teacher.
 The product looks nice with a wall decoration.
 I was very happy with this capo.  I ordered it from Amazon and it works awesome.
 This was exactly what I was looking for. It was exactly what I was looking for!
" You will be able to hear the difference between the two.  You can hear your guitar and you can hear that you are not familiar with.  I don't think you can hear that, but it will do that for you.  You can't find a video video videos on YouTube or recording a song with a drummer.  It just isn't that big as you can see the same thing, but this tuner is really nice.  I've found this tuner to be better, and I know!"
 This for my granddaughter. She can tell her guitar has not be happier. It is very good quality and it looks nice.
" Good product, what more needs for this drywall anchors?"
" I have a Korg GA-30K-30K with a Korg GA-30K-30K.  And it's not exactly what I expected.  I don't even know how to really know how to use it.  I have no idea why, but I can't figure it out.  I know.  I can say that the Korg GA-30K is the best out of the way.  I have a Korg GA-30K and it sounds a little more good.  I had no idea what to get with this product.  I'm not sure what the manufacturer wrote about this product and I am not a fan.  The best part is that the product is for me.  The price is right.  The product is the best part of the purchase.  I know, because I am a musician but this is not a fan of the price I guess.  This is a really fun item, but it has no means to be bought for my family.  I'm not a fan of a professional and I have found it will be a good value.  Overall, I am satisfied."
 Works great.
 The product shipped on time and I would give it 5 stars.
 Very good
 I purchased this item as a gift.  The price was excellent and what a good product!
 Just what I needed
 I have been using this pedal for years and I can say that this pedal has the best.
" I've used this product for years. I've used this product for about a year and have never had any problems. I have a Furman power conditioner. I have not had it for a month now and I'm a fan.

I have a Furman Power Conditioner and it works great!

The Furman Power Conditioner and Furman Power Conditioner, no problems and will last for years."
 The best thing:  and works great.  The only problem is that you can get rid of charge.  I'm just a musician and I'm not going to try this stuff.
 Works great.
 Great product
" I'm a beginner and I'm a professional musician.  I did a bit research on this brand it was priced well.  It's a no brainer instrument but it's worth the money for a few dollars.  I am planning to upgrade it as I am very confident in learning.  I've never played it for about 10 minutes and it is pretty good.  I'm a beginner and I'm not expert on learning to play.  I've read the reviews on this model.  I did a few tests videos of videos on YouTube videos and I am pretty impressed.  This is a quality instrument, so I will update if I'm a pro or I can go.  It has a good sound quality and the price is excellent.  So far I'm satisfied with this purchase.  I'm a beginner and I'm a beginner.  I'm satisfied."
 The Korg MA30 Ultra Compact Digital Tuner is a very accurate tuner. The tuner is very accurate and accurate. The clip fits the clip. The clip included is adjustable and the clip is very accurate on the Korg MA30. It is very accurate and accurate if you are not familiar with the clip. You can't get a better deal. I plan on using this unit for my Korg MA30 Ultra Compact one. I don't know what I got was using the clip.
 This is an excellent microphone for the price.  The sound quality is excellent.  The sound quality is excellent.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for an inexpensive microphone.
 Fantastic strap for the price.  This is what I was looking for.  Strap is a bit more comfortable on the floor or floor.
 Good quality strap for the $60 price!
 Its very nice. A great price.
 I will say that this does. It is the worst. It is not what I need. If you want to improve the sound and you can buy it yourself.
 great quality and quality.  very good price.
 Works great and I don't have to worry about my Shure SM57
 These are the best and they last longer than any other string that I've ever used.
" I've had this strap for a few years I've been playing for over 40 years. I've never had a problem, and it looks great, and very comfortable for a small person."
" I love this mic, it's great quality and the price is it the one I bought it.  I will definitely buy this mic again.  I'm at a music store, and this mic is worth every penny"
 This is a very good quality product. The sound quality is great. The only thing that I can say about it is I am I will say that this was my first purchase. I have a few other kits but this is not a problem. The only thing I will say is that the sound quality is better than the rest of the kit. There is a slight hum which is not a problem. I don't think this is a great product.
 This case is well made and it has a price to it.
" This is a great value, and it was easy to find. The seller is very responsive. I am satisfied with this purchase."
" I am using these to set up. They work well, but the price is right."
 I got this for my 2 year old niece and she loves it.  She has to play it daily and it is pretty cheap.
" I was very pleased with this purchase.
I was pleasantly surprised when I first bought this recorder for my granddaughter. She loves it. It was well made and sounds great!"
 Very well made.
 Good value.
" The set was exactly what I was looking for, as described, and I'm glad I did."
 This is the first one I'm used to use. I've been using it for a few years and the price is very reasonable. I'm glad I found this one.
 This was my first Squier Telecaster and I love the sound. I've found a lot of people who say the Squier is a great company and I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm a guitar player and this amp's a good buy to anyone looking at an awesome deal.
 I'm a beginner guitarist and I've never seen a better deal. I've never played guitar before but this is my first guitar and I've been playing for a year. I've been playing guitar for a year now and I'm only learning to play with it for a few years now.
 This item was purchased for my husband and he loves it.
 I had a pair of these for my son and he loves them.
" The sound quality is very good. I can't get rid of it. I have a ""pitch"" I'm not happy with!"
 Works great
" I'm a professional pianist, and this thing is a beauty to do. I'm a professional pianist, and I'm a professional pianist."
" I've been playing guitar for over 40 years and it wasn't even a real deal, and I am very pleased. I can't say it's a good deal and I am very satisfied.  I am a beginner and I am not familiar with guitars before."
 Good product
 I'm an absolute beginner and I'm a little over 50 years old. I'm pretty impressed to see how to play.
" I'm a beginner and I'm not a professional musician. The amp is a bit pricey and I'm satisfied. The amp is a little lacking but I'm not very satisfied with this purchase. The amp is a great amp for anyone who is an absolute beginner. It is a really good amp. I've been playing with it for years.

Pros:
- The amp is great and will really be for recording with it. The amplifier is only one that may be a little smaller. The amp works and the amp is not so loud."
 Well made and perfectly functional and sturdy.
 nice
" This is a great strap for the price.  The ends are very sturdy, and the strap is fine for the price.  The strap is nice for a banjo."
 I bought this item hoping it would work perfectly.
 Ive used it for years and it works great.
 This product has been a worthwhile addition to my gear gear and I am happy with the quality of this product.  I use it every day for my gear.  The quality is great for the price and will definitely buy it again!
 The product is just as advertised in the photo. The item was pictured and I was not the item pictured. The product description is not the item I received and it was shipped promptly. I would not have to buy another one.
 I was a little hesitant about the product being as described for the price.  They are good and easy to install.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
 Works perfectly.
 I bought this product. It's for the price I paid.
" The guitar is my second favorite guitar.  The quality is very good.  The sound is great.  I would definitely recommend this guitar to anyone.  The guitar is made out of my cheap case and the guitar is very well made and has a good sound.  The guitar is very solid.  The guitar is a great value for the price!  I am a beginner and a beginner.  The guitar feels very well made and will last for years.  There are a few dollars more, and you won't find a better one.  The guitar is a great buy for your price point."
" I like this capo for bass guitar.  It is very sturdy and well made and will last longer than any other capo I have ever made.  It has adjustable adjustment and seems to have a rubber clip.  I don't think this is a super tight fit for my guitar.  I don't think the product would be as tight on the bottom of the string, but I am hoping there are a few different types of pressure on the strings."
 I use this for my Blue Yeti.
 I love these picks! They sound great!
" Does not like this product.  I have to say, I like the strings."
 Good strings
 This product is exactly what I was expecting. It was exactly what I needed. It is very well made and sounds great.
" Good tool for your bass, you'll need it for your guitar.  I recommend it for anyone who wants to improve guitar/nimers"
 I was going to replace the original strings with the Martin M-1 Light Bass System with a guitar that came with the guitar. It was a big deal and well worth the money. The guitar is a high quality guitar and I will definitely buy this product again.
 I would buy again
 I used this for my guitar and it was much better than the plain version that came with the guitar.
" I really can't say how easy it is to set up.  I'm not a gigging musician.  But it is a fun little thing to me that I can't tell is to play!  The only issue is that it doesn't come with a cord.  If you are looking for a portable, portable amplifier that I would recommend this."
 I need to listen to my voice through the amp.  I am using a standard metronome for my son and he is very happy with this metronome.
 I bought this for my son and he loves it.  It came in the timely manner.
 Works great
" The guitar sound is really loud and the sound was not the right size for my Martin SG. If you're looking into an inexpensive guitar that will work well for you, then this guitar will serve you well."
" I bought this for my 10 year old son, and we are working in his home studio.  The sound is very good.  I would not recommend this item for anyone who is looking for a great studio monitors.  I was curious to hear the sound of the speakers.  But it works great."
 The strings stay in tune for longer than any other string I have.
 This is a well made and well built. It is a nice package that you will be able to buy one.
 The strap came with the strap.
 I got this item on time and it works great. It is a tuner.
" I'm not a fan of the sound and build quality I've used. I've played a lot of these microphones, and I'm not sure about them. I don't know if I'm not going to be playing a lot but I'm a professional musician."
 A+++
" I have an old box of these and they are very poorly made.  They are not made out of plastic and won't fit them.  They are cheaply made but they are thin and they are not very durable.  The picture is they are not made out of plastic!  They are cheap, and are not made in China."
 Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
 This is a great product. It came as expected.  Thank you.
" This is a great tool for the pedalboard. I have never had to use it as a pedalboard and I will be getting it through a pedalboard. There is a reason it is a very well built pedal pedal and the pedalboard is a bit more complicated. I have found only one thing I can say about it is it. The pedal board is not a big deal breaker, but it is not a big deal for anyone who has a pedal board."
 This is an amazing product and I'm a amateur musician and I am a professional percussionist.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  The price is reasonable.  I think this is a very good product and I will definitely buy it.
" I'm not a fan of the thin nylon tips, so I didn't have to use them"
 This product is perfect!
" I'm not a professional guitarist. The quality is great and the price is excellent. I have found no problems. All I can say is, I'm satisfied."
 Great product.
 No problems. Good price for a good product.
 I love this guitar for the price.
 I am using it every day and it's perfect and is exactly what I needed.
 I bought this for my husband and he seems to be able to use it with all the things he has. He likes it. She has been playing it for over a year and it is perfect!
" Great product, good price and delivered on time."
 Love it
" This mic is not great!  I bought it for my son as a gift he will have.  I didn't have an expert, but I am a musician and I know what we're doing.  I know we have bought this mic.  It does not fit your needs.  I can't be wrong and it looks like a studio.  Maybe I just got the wrong adapter, but you can't get a better deal.  I do not like it and it has no clue.  It does not fit the microphone.  I wish it had a cord."
 This is a great value
 Great product for the price.
" I bought this for my YPG-235 keyboard!  It works for me.  I don't understand how to tighten it, but it is very easy to set and just be careful you get it, but not as quick as I can tell.  It is adjustable, so it does not have a ""cump"" on the ""wish"" keyboard.  I like the noise as it is plugged into the computer.  No problem!  But it is a good deal for the price."
 Works great.
 Thanks
 I like these strings.
 This is a great mic cord for the price. If you're looking for a quality sound that is much better than this one for the price.
 Works great!
 This cord has worked great and the price was excellent.
 Great product.
 This is the only one that I'm not getting. The bass is so comfortable and is a bit high quality.
 I've used this product for years and I've never let down yet. It works.
 This is a great microphone for a starter.  I'm a beginner and this microphone is the best I've found.
" Just what I needed, works great."
 Excellent strap
 I don't know how to use this product.
 I've had these for up to my local music store where they are not the same thing. I wouldn't have to buy these again. I don't know why.
" The Shure SM48-LC Vocal/Instrument Microphone
I'm using this with a podcasting for interviews with podcasts and interviews. It's a great price!"
 The product is exactly what I expected. I'm using this item for my son to learn on.
" I've played this metronome for over a year and it has kept the beats beat.  I've heard a lot of people say about this metronome but this metronome is not a useful tool for anyone who has a music recording system.  The metronome works very well and the price was very reasonable.  The only problem I have found is that the metronome is not useful for the piano.  I know is that in order to work at a gig it is a hassle.  It's ok for a beginner.  But I can't remember, because I'm not a professional musician and I can't figure the beats or anything.  I like this metronome.  I am a beginner and I don't know what I'm doing, but you can't afford this metronome.  You will be able to read the reviews that you have to listen to.  I'm a beginner"
 It's good.  It works very well for me.  It was recommended.
 Good product
 This is a great item and arrived early morning.
 I'm sure these are the best for me.  I use them to tune my acoustic guitar.  The sound quality is great.
" I was working on the go-to for a gig, I have had it for about a year ago and it is now in perfect condition."
 Thanks!
 I'm a professional musician and I don't know how to play. I don't know how to play it. But I'm going to change it to something different from what I know.
 This is the best strap I've ever used and it is the best quality I've ever had.
 My husband is the best he has ever owned. He's happy with it and he is in love with it.
 This strap is good.  It's a good price and the price is right.  It's pretty comfortable.  I use it for a new guitar player.
" This is the best way to record!  Easy to use, and great price!"
" This is a great product, well made and looks great. The sound quality is very good."
" I bought this item, it works perfectly and looks great. It has a nice sound to it. The bridge is great."
 Works great!!
 This is a decent microphone for the price. It does not disappoint your favor at all.  But for the price it is a good product.
 I love this thing! I've been playing guitar for over 50 years and this is my favorite one. I've had it for over a year and I will keep it!
" The case has a great finish, the bag is made of sturdy wood on the bottom. The zippers are sturdy and the zippers are sturdy. The zippers are very well constructed. The zippers are very well made. The zippers are very well made and the zippers are great. The zippers are very well made and the zippers are made of quality wood construction. The zippers are well made and the zippers are well made, the zippers feel like a guitar strap can be carried around a wall. I got this for my granddaughters."
 I love this product.
 As expected
" I use this for a concert band and it is a great addition to our band. It is easy to read and does what I do.

I'm not a fan of it, but it is a very good price."
 This pedal does not fit so it's not worth $10.
 I picked this up and it was shipped promptly. I am happy with the purchase.
 These are the best I've ever used. They are the right size for my Martin.
 Good value and great sound!
" I have had this mic for 5 years, and am very pleased.  The sound is good, and the price was very reasonable.  I've had it for over a year now and it still works very good.  I like it so far.  It's a good price for a good microphone for the price."
" This is my first string, and it's my go to strings and my wife is pretty happy. She's happy with it."
" Product works great! I use it for music, and it works well for both. I use it for my music room."
 Very useful
 Great strings. Good price for the price
 The microphone was shipped on time and it works fine. I will try this one again.
 I bought this item for my son who doesn't want to record with his record player. He loves it.
 Works well
" This color and the blue color matches, nicely made. The black color is a bit thin, but it does not match the black color of the pick."
 The guitar is great! I love it!!
" Works great, does what it should for the price. Love it!"
 Excellent
 Great strings
" I am an absolute beginner's music teacher and this was my first choice for my child. I am a bit concerned about the sound quality of this product. After reading some reviews I decided to try a digital recorder. I decided to try this out. I was looking forward to learning to play the recorder. The sound quality is very good, the sound is very good. I am not sure it was a great purchase. If you are looking for a portable music recorder that can just go with a USB cable, you won't find one that is not bad."
 This is a very high quality product and they sound great.  It is a bargain for the price.
" I didn't like it.  It worked great.  The only thing I didn't like about it is that it was not useful for me.  But for what it's worth I am very satisfied.  The only quibble is that it's not a power adapter.  I can't tell it is a ""snapped"" adapter.  It is really annoying, but is a bit annoying.  I'm not sure what happened before.  I'm not sure if this was my issue.  If it's a bad idea.  How would anyone else get this for a few dollars?  I'm hoping the best solution for something I am going to use.  Because I don't know, you need to buy one of these.  I must buy another one, but I would only buy another of these.  It works well for me."
 This product has a great sound and is easily fixed.
" If you don't know how to play guitar, then you won't be able to play your guitar, and this is just fine. If you're looking for a guitar that won't even fit it, and if you want it, or like me, you won't be disappointed."
 The amp is made so it doesn't sound like a real amp.
 Great product!
" I'm a band and I live in a park and we have this power supply.  I have used it for about a year and it works great.

I have a small space, so I can't complain."
 This is the only pedal I have ever used. The sound is great. I have used it for a few years and it will last for one day.
 I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She really loves it.
" I'm using this for my guitar.  This is my first recorder and it's amazing.  I'm using it for recording with a stereo amplifier.  This thing is super portable, and I'm very satisfied.  The sound is good to the music store, but it is not that good.  The only reason I'm not satisfied is because it's loud!  I'm not afraid to want to go loud.  It's pretty loud for a little video recording, but it's not loud enough for my use."
" I like these strings better than i have ever bought, i use them all the time!"
 I bought this pedal board to try with my guitar. I needed a pedalboard and found the Hosa GTR-110 was my only one. I don't know how to get this thing working out. So far it is working perfectly. I am very happy with this pedal board.
" This is a great tuner. The only reason I didn't like it is that it can be use for long period playing. The only down side is the sound is only. If you use this to record, you can get a lot more realistic sound from a guitar. The way it will play has a good volume. If you have a big amp, this may be the best tuner amp you have ever owned. I am not very satisfied with this pedal.

I use this with a guitar amp and it sounds great. I love this pedal for my gigging."
 I am very pleased with this product!
 This instrument is my first guitar. The guitar wall hanger and wall hanger are the best for rock. The wall hanger is awesome. The hanger is the worst. It's solid and the wall hanger and wall hanger to wall is not the one I have ever used. I really like the wall hanger. I am using it for a string guitar.
" I don't really know how to use this product, but it works perfectly. I love the sound quality."
 I am very pleased with these strings.  They love playing them.  They are great.
 This is a great metronome and has to be rewind.
 Use it as a gift.
 I got this for my boyfriend who is a percussionist. He has to play the drums. He enjoys it.
" I can't say, but for $50 you won't find anything better! I have four guitars and I am sure they all are the same."
" Good item, works well."
" The picks I've used for years. I mostly use the regular and the other picks, and this one is one of those the most reliable picks."
 I got this guitar to make a few extra dollars to get it. I really like the sound of the action. I have played with it for about 6 months now and it still sounds great. I'm happy with the purchase!
" I'm not a professional band, but I don't know what to expect from this unit. I've had these for about a year and they still work. I've used it for me for a few months now and it's working really well."
" My husband is a bass player and we have a lot of guitars, we have both.  I have one for each and a bass guitar.  It is an inexpensive and works well for anyone who is looking for an inexpensive guitar that is not cheap.  The only problem we have is it was the strings that are included in my collection.  If you need to buy one for a gig or a gig it won't be beat."
 I'm a musician and this is my first drum set. I love it. It is a great value for the price.
 Works great
 Exactly what I was looking for!
 This is my second one.
 The best buy.
 Works great
 Works great and easy to use.
" I love this tuner.
great price."
 I purchased this for my son and he loves it.
" I've owned the Shure PG48-LC V-mount for less than a year, and it works great."
 I don't know how to handle the guitar. It works very well. I would say that it is not quite durable for its purpose. I find it very useful for the price. I am glad that it was the product description and the description.
" I've been playing guitar for over 40 years. I mostly play mostly for a while, and I play mostly jazz and jazz. Most of the other guitars are for me, but I really love them. They have a great sound, and I find them both are pretty good sounding for the price. They're a good value for a beginner who has had no interest."
 I bought this for my granddaughters son.  He is having difficulty keeping the pedal on the floor.  First he says that it is well made and is a good price for a beginner.  But we're not going to know how to do it.  It is a great deal for the price.  The price should be reasonable.
 Good price and good product
" I'm not a fan of this mic, I bought this to protect my SM57, I got a spare one for my SM57 and it works. No problems at all."
" Just as described.  I really needed a simple set up.  This set was perfect.  It was shipped on time.  I would just recommend this item for the price.  I'm a beginner and I think this is a great deal for the price.  I'm just a beginner and I'm having fun with drums, and I'm very glad I did.  I'm very happy with the set up.  I'm a bit happy with the purchase.  I found out how it was shipped.  I'm glad I did.  I can't say because I'm not a seasoned drummer and I'm not a musician in the past.  I would be a beginner so I'm going to stick with it.  The drums are all they are supposed to do, but I feel like I would do.  I know the sound is better but I don't use"
" Easy to set up, easy to follow, and the sound quality is excellent. The string is easy, and the price was right. Just didn't like the sound quality and the price is right."
 Works well and we've worked with it.
 Great product!
 The strap is well constructed and it does fit for me. The length is right
 I'd like it for most people but the sound is great.
" I love these strings.  They are awesome and I hope they last longer than any other strings I have used.  They are the best strings I've ever used, if you can afford a cheap brand, these are your strings you.  If you've been using these on a stage or a gig, these are a great value."
 I've only had it for a few months now and it still works great and is easy to use.
" I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  The cable is a cord that is a little pricey and won't break.  The cord is great for small venues without disturbing the house.  I've had this one for over a year and it seems pretty durable.  I don't need it for long practice, but I have to say that I'd been a good value and I'm very satisfied with the quality."
 The product is perfect!
 I use it for my bass and acoustic guitars. Perfect!
 I just got this for my 5th grade guitar. It is great sound. I think it sounds better than the one you got.
 Works great for a cheap price.
" This is my first set of these and they are the best. They are quality, they are solid and strong, the best. I think they are high quality.

I like the sound and the price."
 I love it!  My guitar is a good quality!
 I love these strings.  They last longer than any other string and they last longer than any other strings I've ever used.
" This unit does exactly what I needed it to do.  It's not a paperweight and does the job.  It's a solid piece of paper, which is what I expected to buy."
 Just what I needed it for. I'm a new guitar player and I'm a beginner.
 I was looking for a pedal.
 Works fine and works great.
" I'm not disappointed

I love the sound of the strings."
 ok
 This product is sturdy and fast shipping!  I bought it for my church.  I use it as a gift.
 Great strap for the price.
 I like Ernie Ball and the strings are my favorite.
" I've been using this set for years.  I've had every string of course.  I've yet to break it, but never I'll ever say I'm very impressed with these strings.  I don't know how to play my electric guitar, but I think I'll really improve my skills.  If you're looking for a high quality amp that will last a long time, then these are the best you can buy.  I use it for my acoustic guitar and it's a bit more fun."
 This was exactly what I needed.
" I like these picks, but I can probably get a good deal of the difference between the two for me.  The thinner picks are less big, and they feel different and give me a lot more flexibility.  I don't know how the difference between the two and the picks is better, but this was just one of the reasons I say.  The price is reasonable, but it was a worthwhile buy for me."
 I bought this and I'm happy with it.
" I am a bass player and this guitar is recommended for me. The guitar and bridge is also a great guitar. The neck is easy to play and I love the action. The neck is so comfortable to play, not a piece of wood. I will buy a better guitar for my bass player."
 The strap is perfect for my guitar!
" This strap is super comfortable and does the job.

It's not a piece of any fancy design.
It's a quality strap and is a little bit wider but for the price it's a very comfortable strap.

I wouldn't expect any better straps from this type strap."
 I love these. They're nice and they sound amazing.
" Great sound quality. I've got it, but I don't play it."
" I bought this strap a few years ago.  I love Ernie Ball straps.  The straps are comfortable and they will last for years as far as possible.  There are no issues with this strap.  I think I have to return it back a little, but it is my second one.  I would recommend it for any other guitar player.  I own a Gibson Les Paul and it fits any Gibson Les Paul Les Paul Les Pauls.

 Great
" I bought these picks for my boyfriend's guitar. He says they are good and have a good grip. He is a big guy, but his guitar teacher said it was a good purchase."
" The product description says ""The product description is on the box and it was not very pictured.
The one pictured box was ""No CD, it's not the one pictured.
The thing is that the product description says ""I got this item in the box. It was a real disappointment.
I'm not going to have to send it back back to it."
 I've had these for about five months now and they maintain their own good quality.  They look nice and they have a great sound.  The price was right.
